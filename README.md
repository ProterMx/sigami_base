FEATURES
________

We’ve built the WP Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is as a very basic theme or as a starting point for theme developers. It uses v3.3.1 of Bootstrap.

WP-Bootstrap uses grunt as a task manager to help aid development. Check out the gruntfile.js file for more detail on the default tasks. WP-Bootstrap comes with the livereload, less, grunticon and more tasks out of the box. 

Watch or star this project to keep up with its progress.

WP-Bootstrap is translated in 7 languages - Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and German. 

Page Templates

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page
